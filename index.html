  <p> <strong> Reasons for taking the course </strong>:
    <ul>
      <li> I want to build my own website </li>
      <li> I like coding in general </li>
    </ul>
  <p> <strong> Prior experience </strong>: I have taken two programming courses
                                           before </p>

  <p> <strong> Goal for this course </strong> : Create my own website with many
                                                cool functions </p>

  <p> <strong> Summary of Command Line, Shell, Terminal, Bash activity </strong> : In this activity,
      I learned the definitions of many essential terms in the topic of the command
      line and the syntax when using it ($, #, and && symbols). Next, I learned
      how to perform simple computer functions with the command line
      namely navigating, creating, editing files and running a Python scripts.
      In addition, I tried to learn more shell commands through many references
      available online (such as "open", "mv", and "rmdir" commands). In order to
      reinforce my knowledge, I took a quiz and read extra materials I found online
      and revisited the slides shown in class.
  <p> <strong> Interesting projects </strong>
    <ol>
      <li> <a href = "https://stars.chromeexperiments.com/" target = "_blank">
            100000 Stars </a>
            <p> This website showcases an interactive 3D visualization of the
                stellar neighborhood including over 100000 nearby stars.
                Overall, the graphics is really beautiful and it's amazing how
                the authors managed to recreate the visualization of many stars
                and add detailed descriptions of all of them. </p>
      <li> <a href = "https://www.notion.so/" target = "_blank" > Notion </a>
           <p> Notion is an all-in-one workspace where you can write, plan, collaborate
               and get organized. Its flexibility is what make Notion such an
               amazing site. Notion is incredibly flexible. It can be a writing
               repository, task management software, a workout calendar,
               a database, and so on.
